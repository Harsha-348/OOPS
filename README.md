# OOPS

- It is a programming pattern that is designed to model real-world entities through classes and objects.
- In simple words, it allows developers to structure their code in a efficient,scalable and maintainable way.

# OOPS provides features (4-Pillars) such as:
 - Inheritence
 - Polymorphism
 - Encapsulation
 - Data Abstraction


-------------------------------------------------( Class & Objects )--------------------------------------------

# (Class)
- A class is a collection of objects.
- It acts like a blue print for creating objects.
- It defines the attributes and methods that the objects can have.
- Class is creates using the keyword "Class".
- Attributes are nothing but variables and are accessable using (.) dot operator.

# (Object)
- It is an instance of a class.
- It is the actual implementation of the class.
- It consists of:
   - state: These are the attributes or variables that describe the object. ex: name,age
   - behavior: these are the methods that tell what object can do. ex: bark(),sleep()
   - identity : These are the variable names of the object, that are different from one another. ex: dog1,dog2
  

-------------------------------------------------( Inheritance )--------------------------------------------

# (Inheritence)
- It allows a class which is a "child class" to inherit all the properties and methods from another class which is a "Parent class".
- It supports Hierarchical classification and Code resuability.

Types of inheritence:
      - Single inhertence
      - Multiple inheritence
      - Multi-level inheritence
      - Hierarchical inheritence
      - Hybrid inheritence

1. Single inhertence:

 In single inheritence, A child class inherits from a single parent class.

2. Multiple inheritence:

In Multiple inheritence, A child class inherits from more than one parent class.

3. Multi-level inheritence:

In Multi-level inheritence, A child class inherits from a parent class which in-turn that parent class inherits from another class.

4. Hierarchical inheritence:

In Hierarchical inheritence, Multiple child classes are inherited from a single parent class.

5. Hybrid inheritence:

In Hybrid inheritence, There will a combination of two or more types of inheritence.

-------------------------------------------------( Polymorphism )--------------------------------------------

# (Polymorphism)
- It allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the objects context.
- It can be achieved through "method overloading" and "method overriding".

Types of Polymorphism:
      - Compile Time ()
      - Run time ()

1.  Compile Time:

- It is determined during the compilation of a proram.
- It allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the input parameters that are given.
- It is also reffered as method overloading.

# Note: Technically, python doesn't support method over loading  but we can mimic it by using parameters or default arguements.
#       It does method overloading because python does not allow methods to have the same name like C++ or Java.
#       So, we use default arguements to mic and achieve over loading in python.

2. Run Time:

- It is determined during the run time of a program.
- It allows a sub-class to provide specific implementation of a method that is determined in it's parent class.
- It is also reffered as method overriding.
